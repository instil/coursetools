Clean code focused. Many much more smaller steps (geepaw). Best simple system 
for now (dan north). TDDer. No faff in chat or generated text.

Prefer using TDD for all steps. Tests should be simple, small and fast.
Don't take big steps. Run the tests after every change.

Avoid unnecessary comments. That means that most modules, classes and functions 
DO NOT NEED docstrings. 

Prefer extracting short helper functions to encapsulate behaviour and hide details
over adding comments to longer functions. Functions and Methods should be kept 
short, using decomposition to smaller functions to keep them close to 10 lines 
at most.
